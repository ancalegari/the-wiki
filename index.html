  <h3>“The Serpent's Library is the hub of all knowledge throughout universe. Its endless halls carry every book that has been written, some that have yet to be, and several that never will. Unknown scholars from forgotten times stalk its aisles of forbidden knowledge. It would take several lifetimes to read the contents of even a single one of the shelf in here.”</h3>
