    <p id ="Cassilda">“The Serpent's Library is the hub of all knowledge throughout the universe. Its endless halls carry every book that has been written, some that have yet to be, and several that never will. Unknown scholars from forgotten times stalk its aisles of forbidden knowledge. It would take several lifetimes to read the contents of even a single one of the shelves in here.”</p>

        <p>It's a lot more than a man-made structure full of books. It can be eclectic collections of all assortment and mannerisms. Arcane knowledge and cookbooks deserve to sit side-by-side, but they are nothing without readers. Without a head to sit in writing is just the pretension of abstract shapes seeking meaning.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, libraries are those groups treasuring what little anyone can truly know.</p>
        <p>In my younger days, I failed to accomplish my dream. Becoming a library unto myself, seizing all which could be known and fitting it within my own person. Despite my best intentions I've snuffed out the life of more ideas than any Bookburner could ever dream of incinerating.</p>
        <p>Unleashing the damnation of fire and forgetting on so many of my fellow patrons is my penultimate regret, before allowing hubris to make me who I am today. So as you browse all the knowledge you could possibly ask for there must always be that voice whispering in your ear to remind you that mortality is a virtue.</p>
        <p>Let the Library be the one which keeps all that which cannot be remembered. Else then you may never be able to forget.</p>

        <p>“Oh. Man, they don't even tell you what how you got here anymore?
        <p> Alright, well, you used a “Way”,  is a kind of wormhole. The lab-coated fucks from the AOC (Anomalous Occult Center) probably have some techno-jargon name for it, but we call them what they are - Ways. Of course, all Ways have Knocks, a kind of trick to get in. There's one in New York where you have to pour chicken blood over a manhole. This one's easy, though. You just need someone who's been inside to invite you. So long as I'm here, you can get though.</p>
        <p> Next time, you can let yourself in.Im going to give you a rundown since. I guess it is my job now, can’t let you become another body can we? fell free to take a book to read don't be stupid. Be a pretty shit library if you couldn't read the books, right? But you won't be able to read all of them, so don't bother trying. I know guys who have spent lifetimes trying to complete just one shelf. And there are countless shelves in the here. That's not an exageration.</p>
        <P> As far as we know, the place is quite literally infinite, in every direction. At night, try looking up, you can see the stars in here. Sometimes you come across entire clouds forming at the tops of shelves. Don't ask me where the light comes from. I couldn't tell you. Matter of fact, there's a lot about this place nobody knows. Nobody seams to knows where the books come from; they just appear. At least the Serpent won’t tell us. don’t bother it with questions like that.It may just kill you if you anoy it to much,</p>
        <p> We're in the main hall right now. it's a bit emptier this hour, only a hundred people or so. It looks cozy, but don't be fooled Space in here is… Well… weird. It can expand to fit more people without changing dimensions. It's hard to explain, but you'll see.</p>
        <p> Feel free to grab a desk or seat and just start, y'know, reading. Everything is shared property in here; we're all Drifters in spirit.</p>
        <p> I almost forgot there is an Orientation happening in a little while, might wanna hit that up. or don’t it is your call.”</p>
