    <p id ="Cassilda">“The Serpent's Library is the hub of all knowledge throughout the universe. Its endless halls carry every book that has been written, some that have yet to be, and several that never will. Unknown scholars from forgotten times stalk its aisles of forbidden knowledge. It would take several lifetimes to read the contents of even a single one of the shelves in here.”</p>

        <p>It's a lot more than a man-made structure full of books. It can be eclectic collections of all assortment and mannerisms. Arcane knowledge and cookbooks deserve to sit side-by-side, but they are nothing without readers. Without a head to sit in writing is just the pretension of abstract shapes seeking meaning.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, libraries are those groups treasuring what little anyone can truly know.</p>
        <p>In my younger days, I failed to accomplish my dream. Becoming a library unto myself, seizing all which could be known and fitting it within my own person. Despite my best intentions I've snuffed out the life of more ideas than any Bookburner could ever dream of incinerating.</p>
        <p>Unleashing the damnation of fire and forgetting on so many of my fellow patrons is my penultimate regret, before allowing hubris to make me who I am today. So as you browse all the knowledge you could possibly ask for there must always be that voice whispering in your ear to remind you that mortality is a virtue.</p>
        <p>Let the Library be the one which keeps all that which cannot be remembered. Else then you may never be able to forget.</p>
